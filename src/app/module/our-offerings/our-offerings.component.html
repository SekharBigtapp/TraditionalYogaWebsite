                        <h4> In - person Meditation Retreats</h4> <br>
                        <p>Traditional Yoga currently expects to run two to three meditation retreats per year. Students’ performance on the online courses are a pre-requisite for successful application and selection to attend an in-person retreat.</p>
                  
        <p>The retreats offer full-time guidance from Dr. Kumar normally over a ten- or fifteen-day period providing the transformative teachings of Yoga Darshana guided meditation in ‘noble silence’. 
 
                        </p><p>Drawing on thousands of years of profound teaching, Dr. Kumar opens hearts and minds to experience peace, compassion, and connectedness. Whether you are new to meditation or an experienced practitioner, this course will take you through the advanced stages of practice as outlined by the sage Patanjali.  
                        </p><p>In the Yoga tradition, the absorption of pure knowledge from a teacher who embodies and lives the values of yoga is vital for an aspirant’s development. Fully enlightened Guru, Dr. Kumar, draws on his own vast experiential and theoretical knowledge of yoga to guide us through every step of the technique. The teaching is dynamic and responsive to the student group.

              <p>The continuous series of online courses in Yoga and Meditation offered by Traditional Yoga form a comprehensive and ongoing <b>Online Yogi Training Program for students and teachers.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Each online course will have its own specific focus on aspects of Yoga and/or Meditation,</b> and its own <b>related certification should the aspirant choose to apply for certification.</b> </p>

<p><b>Alternatively, aspirants may elect to undertake a course to learn and develop their understanding,</b> and not apply for certification. All online courses are integral to, and address, the Yogi Training Program.</p>

<p><b>An aspirant can join at the beginning of any course.</b> The courses are structured and delivered to enable beginners as well as more advanced yoga practitioners and teachers. </p>

<p><b>All students are assigned a Mentor appointed by Dr. Kumar,</b> and these Mentors maintain regular communication with students via WhatsApp. Mentors in turn communicate through an appointed chief Mentor, who is answerable directly to the Guru. </p>

<p><b>Throughout the year there are a number in-person meditation retreats.</b> Students’ performance on the online courses are a pre-requisite for successful application and selection to attend a retreat.</p>
<p><b>To fully benefit from the vast knowledge and experience of a fully enlightened Guru like Dr. Kumar</b> it is recommended that serious aspirants who look to Yoga for complete transformation, purification and liberation of the body, mind and soul remain on the continuous stream of courses and take the opportunity of further deepening their practice through attending meditation retreats.</p>


<p><b>Each course follows the strict ethos of the lineages and traditions of Indian Vedic Ashrams.</b> To become a student of such a teacher is a great privilege and an incredibly rare opportunity, the criteria to join is not payment (the course is offered free), but suitability based on the attributes of a student outlined by the great Indian Saints and Gurus of the Yoga tradition including gratitude, humility, devotion, interest and a positive attitude.</p>
 
<p>As described above, <b>the courses include meditation which is the most subtle and advanced limb of Yoga.</b> As the great Yogi Swatmarama taught over 1100 years ago, <b>Hatha Yoga practice is an excellent preparation for those who wish to make the journey of deep transformation of the mind, rather than an end in itself.</b> The methodology for working with the mind is given by Saint Patanjali and Dr. Kumar’s lived experience and profound understanding of the ‘Yoga Sutras’ will be at the heart of every course.</p>

<p><b>This is a rare opportunity to make a soul journey with Dr. Kumar,</b> the Guru who is grounded in the ancient traditions and the pure science of Yoga, who has explored the entire field of consciousness and gone beyond, to realise Singularity, enlightenment. This journey cannot be made without the guidance of a teacher who has accomplished it.</p>


<p><b>You will complete the course with a changed perspective on Meditation and life,</b> a deep understanding of the traditional culture and practice, and a profound respect for the lineage of Yogis who have selflessly preserved and passed on this precious wisdom for thousands of years.
</p>
<p><b>You will cultivate discernment about the various techniques and will understand how to practice them correctly.</b> Because of Dr. Kumar’s mastery of practices from such diverse traditions, the purpose, scope and original context of each technique will be taught to a level that is not found in the world today.</p>

<p>Although <b>the course is part-time,</b> it will be powerful and in-depth. Applicants should be ready to immerse themselves deeply in a rigorous, challenging and life-changing experiential training program.</p>

              <p><i>“Very many thanks indeed, respected Sir, for the fine teacher training course that has taken place over the last five months.  Every day brought something new, a fresh topic, a new angle on something familiar.  It has been inspiring and refreshing.  Your limitless generosity knows no bounds as you nurture your students and do everything you can to lead us to experience Pure Consciousness for ourselves.  This has not been taken for granted.  We remember, it is not enough to have a good, an enlightened teacher, there also has to be a good student for learning, for progress to happen.  When you have these two things, an alchemical combustion takes place.  May we walk in your footsteps and be worthy of your instruction.  Sincere thanks and deep gratitude.”</i></p>

              <p>The continuous series of online courses in Yoga and Meditation offered by Traditional Yoga form a comprehensive and ongoing <b>Online Yogi Training Program for students and teachers.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Each online course will have its own specific focus on aspects of Yoga and/or Meditation,</b> and its own <b>related certification should the aspirant choose to apply for certification.</b> </p>

<p><b>Alternatively, aspirants may elect to undertake a course to learn and develop their understanding,</b> and not apply for certification. All online courses are integral to, and address, the Yogi Training Program.</p>

<p><b>An aspirant can join at the beginning of any course.</b> The courses are structured and delivered to enable beginners as well as more advanced yoga practitioners and teachers. </p>

<p><b>All students are assigned a Mentor appointed by Dr. Kumar,</b> and these Mentors maintain regular communication with students via WhatsApp. Mentors in turn communicate through an appointed chief Mentor, who is answerable directly to the Guru. </p>

<p><b>Throughout the year there are a number in-person meditation retreats.</b> Students’ performance on the online courses are a pre-requisite for successful application and selection to attend a retreat.</p>
<p><b>To fully benefit from the vast knowledge and experience of a fully enlightened Guru like Dr. Kumar</b> it is recommended that serious aspirants who look to Yoga for complete transformation, purification and liberation of the body, mind and soul remain on the continuous stream of courses and take the opportunity of further deepening their practice through attending meditation retreats.</p>


<p><b>Each course follows the strict ethos of the lineages and traditions of Indian Vedic Ashrams.</b> To become a student of such a teacher is a great privilege and an incredibly rare opportunity, the criteria to join is not payment (the course is offered free), but suitability based on the attributes of a student outlined by the great Indian Saints and Gurus of the Yoga tradition including gratitude, humility, devotion, interest and a positive attitude.</p>
 
<p>As described above, <b>the courses include meditation which is the most subtle and advanced limb of Yoga.</b> As the great Yogi Swatmarama taught over 1100 years ago, <b>Hatha Yoga practice is an excellent preparation for those who wish to make the journey of deep transformation of the mind, rather than an end in itself.</b> The methodology for working with the mind is given by Saint Patanjali and Dr. Kumar’s lived experience and profound understanding of the ‘Yoga Sutras’ will be at the heart of every course.</p>

<p><b>This is a rare opportunity to make a soul journey with Dr. Kumar,</b> the Guru who is grounded in the ancient traditions and the pure science of Yoga, who has explored the entire field of consciousness and gone beyond, to realise Singularity, enlightenment. This journey cannot be made without the guidance of a teacher who has accomplished it.</p>


<p><b>You will complete the course with a changed perspective on Meditation and life,</b> a deep understanding of the traditional culture and practice, and a profound respect for the lineage of Yogis who have selflessly preserved and passed on this precious wisdom for thousands of years.
</p>
<p><b>You will cultivate discernment about the various techniques and will understand how to practice them correctly.</b> Because of Dr. Kumar’s mastery of practices from such diverse traditions, the purpose, scope and original context of each technique will be taught to a level that is not found in the world today.</p>

<p>Although <b>the course is part-time,</b> it will be powerful and in-depth. Applicants should be ready to immerse themselves deeply in a rigorous, challenging and life-changing experiential training program.</p>

              <p><i>“A few years ago, I took a short meditation course with Traditional yoga under the guidance of Dr Kumar. I’d never met anyone from the tradition before, so it was a bit of a leap of faith. I’d suffered a back injury and knew that a regular meditation practice would help with managing the pain. Initially I had no intention of teaching meditation but the positive changes that I was experiencing just had to be shared. My students included busy mums like me, stressed out blokes and health workers with high blood pressure. And by teaching I was doing! I’m now taking the online trainings with Dr Kumar, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. His teachings and practices have massively improved my health and the health of my family. I feel I’m becoming a better person, a kinder person, a more compassionate human and this positively impacts in all of my relationships. Don’t hesitate to sign up for this training, take that leap because it could be just what you need.”</i></p>

              <p>Traditional Yoga currently expects to run two to three meditation retreats per year. Students’ performance on the online courses are a pre-requisite for successful application and selection to attend an in-person retreat.</p>

<p>Meditation Retreats are suitable for those who are willing to seriously commit to working deeply with Dr Kumar in a live setting, demonstrating the highest level of discipline, dedication and devotion to the teacher, the lineage of Yoga and the teachings. Previous experience is not a requirement. </p>

<p>The retreats offer full-time guidance from Dr. Kumar normally over a ten- or fifteen-day period providing the transformative teachings of Yoga Darshana guided meditation in ‘noble silence’. </p>

<p>To give an example, in May 2022, a meditation retreat was attended by one hundred and fifty students under the personal guidance of Dr Kumar, at Tabo village, in Spiti Valley, in the Himalayas. </p>

<p>Drawing on thousands of years of profound teaching, Dr. Kumar opens hearts and minds to experience peace, compassion, and connectedness. Whether you are new to meditation or an experienced practitioner, this course will take you through the advanced stages of practice as outlined by the sage Patanjali. </p>

<p>Patanjali, a great Yogi who lived in India around 100BC is the author of the Yoga Sutras that teach the path to unbind the mind from suffering. Patanjali teaches a systematic method to achieve this goal, identical in essence to the path taught by Buddha. </p>
<p>In the Yoga tradition, the absorption of pure knowledge from a teacher who embodies and lives the values of yoga is vital for an aspirant’s development. Fully enlightened Guru, Dr. Kumar, draws on his own vast experiential and theoretical knowledge of yoga to guide us through every step of the technique. The teaching is dynamic and responsive to the student group. </p>

<p><b>DAILY SCHEDULE</b></p>

<p>The meditation is practiced in a group and guided by Dr. Kumar. Each meditation lasts around one hour and is followed by relaxation and a break before the next session begins. Usually, six meditations are practiced per day, beginning early in the morning as the sun is rising.</p>
 
<p>Chairs and meditation cushions are available. After breakfast and lunch, there is a period for rest before the next meditations begin. Gentle yoga is practiced throughout the course. The course includes talks by Dr. Kumar that clarify the theory underlying the practice and discuss the path of dharma, illustrated with stories, anecdotes, and analogies that teach us how we can apply these teachings to daily life. </p>

<p><b>NOBLE SILENCE</b></p>

<p>For the duration of the course, all students maintain ‘noble silence’. The aim of this is to allow focus and awareness to stay within, rather than in the outside world. The silence allows one to sink into a deeply peaceful state of mind and most people find that being in silence comes very naturally once the meditation begins. Students are allowed to speak to a mentor if they have any problems.</p>


<p><b>EXPERT GUIDANCE</b></p>

<p>With the expert guidance of Dr Kumar you will learn how to be observers within. As per the traditions and lineages the technique is always transmitted by sound in the form of chanting, having practiced in the most traditional schools and original forms, the teachings from his voice and mastery of the sound of silence will tune us to experience deep peace, purification and transformation.</p>
<p>Every scripture of yoga or spirituality was transmitted down in the form of sound. The tradition is always “as I heard”, “Evam Sutam” “Tvam Shrutam”, so also when learning from Dr Kumar.</p>


<p><b>CODE OF DISCIPLINE</b></p>

<p>Every step given by Patanjali will be practiced on a meditation retreat, so students must commit to the strict code of discipline starting with Yama and Niyama. The last of the Niyama’s of Patanjali is Eeshwara Pranidhanaha, surrender to an enlightened teacher. </p>
<p>The course will uphold this essential aspect of the Yoga tradition in order for students to gain maximum benefit. The teachings of Yoga do not exist without enlightened teachers to convey them and the teaching of the Guru is transformative if the student is able to listen unconditionally and in ‘surrender.’ </p>
<p>This means putting aside one’s expectations, preferences and perceptions, previous knowledge and intellectual conditioning and just being open, keeping the mind as an empty cup to be filled with the purity of the teachings.</p>
